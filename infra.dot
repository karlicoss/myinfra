// TODO highlight edges that we want to eliminate (mostly to/from the internet?)

digraph G {
  // some hack for edges between clusters?

  // size="10,10"

  // ok, newrank doesn't respect clusters..
  // newrank=true;

  // concatenate=true; // eh, doesn't seem to work..

  // rankdir="LR";

  // hmm. used to have this as 'max', but same works a bit neater..
  rank=same;

  // TODO not sure which rank to choose?


  include(`diagram.dot')

# TODO distinguish 'device' and 'service'; display legend

# Demonstrates how much indirection is there if you want to own your data

// TODO trivial connections (e.g. twitter phone app -> twitter are omitted)
// TODO should they be though?

// TODO phone location data

# TODO indicate frequencies?
// TODO kindle (unused)
# TODO mark ones that are running periodically?

// TODO if I draw an edge from UI to phone.... gonna be fun


# TODO hmm. how to still draw a frame around it?

// TODO hmm red:green:blue could be useful..
// TODO not sure about the diamond..

// TODO PDF annotation software and pdf provider?

// TODO as you can see not everything has data access layer
// so there is still something to work on

// TODO ugh. sometimes order of edges seems to matter...

// TODO browser history?

# TODO display google home and mention how useless it is

# TODO motivation for blood
# I'm planning on tracking this for several decades, so providers will change

# TODO could expand mypkg into separate files as well to demonstrate which data is consumed by what?

# TODO mypkg is somewhat specific to my needs
# TODO highlight that it's easy to hook to DAL

# TODO distinguish manual and automatic nodes?

# TODO position borg above

# TODO indicate stuff that is 'inactive' and not used anymore
# TODO e.g. vk.com pipelines

// subgraph cluster_backups {
//   label="Backups";

//   borg;

// }

# TODO mark edges that use cachew?
# I guess too excessive

# TODO also provide dynamic version if someone wants to mess with in browser
# wonder if could allow to show/hide nodes?


# TODO these are read only; contribute to search

# TODO cloudmacs?
# TODO arctee
# TODO link some of my blog posts? E.g. ones using endomondo


# TODO perhaps I need HR provider?

# TODO distinguish regular manual tasks and 'only once' manual tasks
# perhaps highlight regular manual with red
# TODO kobo -- semi manual?


# TODO not sure; maybe instead of multiple edges have one edge with multiple labels?
# TODO show missing links? like HN

# TODO for orger, give more specific examples for static (e.g. used for search) and interactive (e.g. used to process reddit/hn)

# TODO I guess it's nice to mention where I mention certain bits of infrastructure?

# TODO separate layer for inputs? e.g. browser/phone etc

// TODO right. I think I need to add browser history and that's it. publish straigh away after that

}


// TODO not sure what should be first class... e.g. it's nice to be able to change somthing in dot file and rerender immediately
